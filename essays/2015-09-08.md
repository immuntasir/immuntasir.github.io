I am Muntasir Wahed.

I finished my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh in December, 2018. I was involved in Competitive Programming and participated in several national contests. My final year project was "A comparative study of underlying patterns in question answering websites for constructing an effective expert routing model", where I worked on proving a hypothesis about the temporal decay of user feedbacks, and comparing the relative performance of Tag, TF-IDF, and topic model-based approaches, with Nabil Hasan, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cse.du.ac.bd/profile/?people_id=50">Dr. Muhammad Asif Hossain Khan</a> and <a href="http://www.iit.du.ac.bd/about_iit/individual_teacher/48">Dr. Mohammad Shoyaib</a>.  During the last semester of my undergrad, I worked as an intern for Beetles Cyber Security Ltd, where I learned about REST API and maintained a backend server using Django framework. 

I am currently employed as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.enosisbd.com/">Enosis Solutions</a>. As a software engineer, my responsibility is to maintain the frontend and backend of a project, where AngularJS and Spring frameworks are being used respectively. I am also working as a Research Assistant for <a href="https://www.dndlab.org/">Data and Design lab</a>, under the supervision of  <a href="http://www.cse.du.ac.bd/profile/?people_id=46">Dr. Moinul Islam Zaber</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OqlqQTwAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Amin Ahsan Ali</a>. This provides me with a unique opportunity to learn about research methodologies, specifically, data extraction, data cleaning and data visualization.
