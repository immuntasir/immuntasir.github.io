<strong>Teammate</strong>: Riddho Ridwanul Haque

This was completed as part of the CSE-2112 (Object Oriented Programming Lab) course. 

We developed an online keyboard. It is possible to draw various shapes as well as free-hand drawing. We use socket programming to connect multiple user agents through TCP/IP, thus making it possible to draw and share in real time. 

<strong>Source</strong>: I will share the source as soon as I upload the project in Github.
