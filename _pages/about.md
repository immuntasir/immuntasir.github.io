I am currently pursuing my **Ph.D. in Computer Science** at **Virginia Tech**. Broadly I am interested in robust feature representations in machine learning. More specifically, my work encompasses representation learning, multi-modal learning, self-supervised learning, information retrieval, and conversational AI. I have recently received a highly selective Pratt Graduate Fellowship from the CS Department. I was also nominated for the Outstanding Doctoral Student Award. As an *IBM Research* intern, my work resulted in one conference paper under review and one pending patent. I am also part of one of the ten teams selected for the Amazon Alexa Prize Taskbot Challenge 2.  

Before starting my graduate studies, I completed my undergrad at the University of Dhaka. I have prior experience working as a Full Stack Web Developer at Enosis Solutions. More recently, I have worked as a Machine Learning Engineer (R&D) at TigerIT Bangladesh Ltd., where I have worked with signal processing and video classification. I have also worked as a Research Assistant at Data & Design Lab, where I have worked with Satellite data to design socio-economic proxies. While working at Data & Design Lab I have also collaborated with BRAC on UID generation project, COVID-19 data analysis, and the development of a web portal for economic data analysis.

I have a fairly good understanding of statistical concepts and machine learning, and a broad experience with programming language and frameworks, especially Python and C. Additionally, I have experience working with Android and Full Stack Web Development. A combination of these skills makes me a strong candidate for R&D jobs, where prototype development is as important as researching new frontiers.
