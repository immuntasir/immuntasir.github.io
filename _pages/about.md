I am currently pursuing my **Ph.D. in Computer Science** at **Virginia Tech**. Broadly I am interested in robust feature representations in machine learning. More specifically, I am working on contrastive learning, mixture-of-experts, and out-of-distribution detection. I will be working as an intern at **IBM Research** in Summer 2022.

Before starting my graduate studies, I completed my undergrad at the University of Dhaka. I have prior experience working as a Full Stack Web Developer at Enosis Solutions. More recently, I have worked as a Machine Learning Engineer (R&D) at TigerIT Bangladesh Ltd., where I have worked with signal processing and video classification. I have also worked as a Research Assistant at Data & Design Lab, where I have worked with Satellite data to design socio-economic proxies. While working at Data & Design Lab I have also collaborated with BRAC on UID generation project, COVID-19 data analysis, and the development of a web portal for economic data analysis.

I have a fairly good understanding of statistical concepts and machine learning, and a broad experience with programming language and frameworks, especially Python and C. Additionally, I have experience working with Android and Full Stack Web Development. A combination of these skills makes me a strong candidate for R&D jobs, where prototype development is as important as researching new frontiers.
