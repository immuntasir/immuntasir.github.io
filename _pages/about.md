I am a **Ph.D. student** in Computer Science at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**, advised by Dr. Ismini Lourentzou. My research focuses on **trustworthy and multi-modal machine learning**, with interests in vision-language models, grounded response generation, and conversational AI. I specialize in building robust AI models that can handle missing information, mitigate adversarial attacks, and defend against harmful or malicious content.

Previously, I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from Virginia Tech and my B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Dhaka. I interned at IBM Research (Almaden Lab) in the summers of ‘22, ‘23, and ‘24, contributing to projects on LLM evaluation, sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) detection, ontology construction, and human-in-the-loop learning, resulting in a conference paper and two patents (one filed, one pending). 

I am currently co-leading a team in the **Amazon Trusted AI Challenge**, where we are developing code generation models that produce secure, non-vulnerable code and are robust against malicious prompts. Additionally, I was part of a finalist team in the **Amazon Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge 2**, where my work included task-oriented conversational AI, dynamic caching, harmful content filtering, and intent classification.

My industry experience includes roles as a Machine Learning Engineer at TigerIT Bangladesh Ltd., where I worked on video classification and signal processing, and as a Full Stack Developer at Enosis Solutions. As a Research Assistant at the Data & Design Lab, I collaborated on socio-economic modeling using satellite data and developed data-driven tools for BRAC. My expertise spans deep learning, large language models, and robust ML, with strong programming skills in Python, C, and full-stack development.
