I am pursuing my **Ph.D. in Computer Science** at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**, advised by Dr. Ismini Lourentzou. My research focuses on robust feature representations in machine learning, with specific interests in representation learning, multi-modal learning, self-supervised learning, information retrieval, and conversational AI.

During my internships at **IBM Research - Almaden Lab** in Summer '22, '23, and '24, I contributed to projects that resulted in a conference paper and two patents (one filed and one pending).

I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Dhaka and M.Sc. in Computer Science at Virginia Tech. I have worked as a Full Stack Web Developer at Enosis Solutions and as a Machine Learning Engineer (R&D) at TigerIT Bangladesh Ltd., where I specialized in signal processing and video classification.

As a Research Assistant at the Data & Design Lab, I collaborated on projects utilizing satellite data for socio-economic proxies and worked with BRAC on UID generation, COVID-19 data analysis, and developing a web portal for economic data analysis. Additionally, I was part of one of the finalist teams in the Amazon Alexa Prize Taskbot Challenge 2.

I possess a deep understanding of statistical concepts, deep learning, and large language models, along with extensive experience in programming languages and frameworks, particularly Python and C. My background also includes Android and Full Stack Web Development, making me well-suited for R&D roles where both prototype development and pioneering research are critical.
