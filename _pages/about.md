I am a **Ph.D. student** in Computer Science at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**, advised by Dr. Ismini Lourentzou, with an expected graduation in May 2026. My research focuses on **trustworthy and multi-modal machine learning**, with interests in vision-language models, grounded response generation, and conversational AI. I specialize in building robust AI models that can handle missing information, mitigate adversarial attacks, and defend against harmful or malicious content. 

My experience includes internships at **Google DeepMind** on the Gemini App team and three summers at **IBM Research (Almaden Lab)**. My work at Google DeepMind resulted in one paper submitted for internal review and one invention disclosure. Previously, my work at IBM Research on human-in-the-loop learning and PII detection resulted in a conference paper, a granted patent, and two additional invention disclosures.

I am the co-lead of the winning team for the **2025 Amazon Nova AI Challenge**, where we developed models that are robust against malicious prompts and reliably generate code secure against Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). Additionally, I was part of a finalist team in the **Amazon Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge 2**, contributing to task-oriented conversational AI, dynamic caching, and harmful content filtering.

Previously, I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from Virginia Tech and my B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Dhaka. In addition, I have experience working as a Machine Learning Engineer at TigerIT Bangladesh Ltd. and a Full Stack Developer at Enosis Solutions. My expertise spans large language models, vision-language models, conversational AI, and robust ML, with strong programming skills in Python, C, and full-stack development.
